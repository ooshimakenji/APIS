## Environment Variables
API requests for the background image and weather data are now proxied through Netlify Functions. Set the following variables in your Netlify project settings (or a local `.env` file) so these functions can access the API keys:

- `PHOTO_ACCESS_KEY`
- `WEATHER_ACCESS_KEY`

The weather endpoint is configured to return temperatures in **Celsius**.
